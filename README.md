This is our project called TagAlong, a social media application and website that is meant for travelers!<br/> 
This app allows users to share their travels with their friends and family.<br/> 
TagAlong allows users to upload their vacation itineraries for others to use or customize for future vacations!
TagAlong can integrate with other social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.
